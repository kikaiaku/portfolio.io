                <p class="indexBody"> My name is Tom Scarborough. I have been working at Harris Teeter for 15 years now
                    as an assistant
                    market manager. My goals in life are to be able to live a healthy life, and have a family. I want to
                    be able to live life without fear of being able to pay the bills. My hobbie is creating art on the
                    side, and creating code based games. I am married with 3 fur babies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have been trained in: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and C#. I am currently going through UNCC, and they
                    are giving me the knowledge to apply what I have learned in the real world environment. I have
                    worked with a group to create an app that helps cyclist find events and incidents in their area.
